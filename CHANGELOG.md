## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added Rollups end-to-end test using Echo Dapp

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that caused a `authority_claimer::ClaimMismatch` error when reprocessing inputs after a reboot.

### Changed

- Changed the dispatcher to close epochs based on block numbers instead of block timestamps.
- **BREAKING**: replaced `CARTESI_EPOCH_DURATION` with `CARTESI_EPOCH_LENGTH_IN_BLOCKS` to match the new epoch algorithm, and set its default value to 7200 (1 day worth of blocks, in average, considering one block is mined every 12 seconds).

- Added `CARTESI_AUTH_KIND` environment variable to select the blockchain authetication method
- Added structured logging with slog. Colored logs can now be enabled with `CARTESI_LOG_PRETTY` environment variable

### Changed

- Changed `CARTESI_BLOCKCHAIN_ID` type from int to uint64

## [0.9.0] 2023-05-19

### Added

- Added support to Cartesi Machine snapshots
- [Script](onchain/rollups/test/foundry/dapp/helper/README.md) for updating proofs used in unit tests
- Authority consensus model implementation (single validator)

- `CartesiDApp` does not implement [EIP-2535](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) anymore
- Made each Portal a contract of their own, and shared amongst all the DApps
- Made inputs added by Portals more compact by using the [packed ABI encoding](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode) instead of the standard one
- Made ERC-20 deposits more generic by allowing base layer transfers to fail, and adding a boolean field signaling whether it was successful or not

- Input boxes are now append-onlyâ€”they are not cleared every new epoch (old Input Facet)
- Modularized the consensus layer (a DApp can now seamlessly change its consensus model)
- Modularized the claim storage layer (a consensus can now seamlessly change how it stores claims)
- Voucher bitmask position is now determined by the input index (in the input box) and output index
