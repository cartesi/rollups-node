# This compose file contains the config to run the node with the Sepolia testnet.
# The config points to the echo Python application running in Sepolia.
# It is necessary to set the RPC provider URLs in the RPC_*_URL environment variables.
# Notice the node will run in reader mode, so it doesn't need a Ethereum wallet.
