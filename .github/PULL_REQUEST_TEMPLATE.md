> [!WARNING]
> Although this software is open source and we welcome contributions, we believe these contributions should be preceded by an open discussion.
> Open discussions tend to result in better solutions to any given problem, and help maintain and improve the quality of the software.
> If you would like to see a bug fixed or a new feature implemented, please open an issue for the discussion rather than directly opening a pull request.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please make sure to check our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-node/blob/main/docs/contributing.md) and, most importantly, review our [Contributing License Agreement](https://forms.gle/k3E9ZNkZY6Vy3mkK9), sign and send it to [info@cartesi.io](mailto:info@cartesi.io) before we can proceed.

When you finally create a pull request, please follow these guidelines:

- Make sure the description clearly describes the problem, its solution, and references the associated issue;
- Do not create large pull requests (involving many different changes) because these are difficult to review.
Instead, break large changes into smaller ones and create independent pull requests for each one;
- Use different pull requests for different issues. Each pull request should address a single issue;
- When fixing a bug or adding a new feature, make sure to add tests that cover your changes.
This will ensure the changes will continue to work in the future;
- Verify that changes do not break the tests. You can check this with `make test`;
- Follow the same coding style rules as the rest of the code base;
- Pull requests for stylistic changes (or even simple typos or grammatical errors) may be rejected.
Pull requests should always address worthy issues.
